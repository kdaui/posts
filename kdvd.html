                <li>**2012:** Kendrick returns the favor with Drake on his critically acclaimed "good kid, m.A.A.d city."</li>

        <h2>The Spark: "Control" and Friendly Fire (2013)</h2>
        <p>The year 2013 marked a turning point. Here's what went down:
            <ul>
                <li>**Kendrick drops a verse on Big Sean's "Control."**  This verse included lines many interpreted as dissing Drake and other rappers, including J. Cole and Pusha T. However, Kendrick later clarified it as "pushing the genre forward" and "friendly competition."</li>
                <li>**Debate erupts online.** Fans and critics dissect the lyrics, sparking discussions about competition and lyricism in hip-hop.</li>

        <h2>March 2024: The Feud Ignites</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>**Future, Metro Boomin, and Kendrick Lamar release "Like That."**  Many believe Lamar's verse includes subtle digs aimed at Drake, referencing his ghostwriting rumors and his "sensitive" persona.</li>
                <li>**Drake responds swiftly with "Family Matters."**  The gloves come off as Drake accuses Lamar of hypocrisy regarding his social commentary and even throws in personal attacks.</li>
            </ul>

                <li>**Not done yet, Lamar releases "Not Like Us,"** taking things a step further with disturbing allegations of pedophilia.</li>
                <li>**On May 5th, Drake attempts to defend himself with "The Heart Part 6"**  He denies all accusations and claims Lamar was misled about the secret child.</li>
