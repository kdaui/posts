        <h2>Humble Beginnings (2011-2012)</h2>
        <p>Before the diss tracks and drama, Kendrick Lamar and Drake had a friendly working relationship. They even collaborated on tracks! Let's explore their early interactions: 
            <ul>

                <li>**2012:** Kendrick returns the favor with Drake on his critically acclaimed "good kid, m.A.A.d city."</li>

        <h2>The Spark: "Control" and Friendly Fire (2013)</h2>
        <p>The year 2013 marked a turning point. Here's what went down:
            <ul>
                <li>**Kendrick drops a verse on Big Sean's "Control."**  This verse included lines many interpreted as dissing Drake and other rappers, including J. Cole and Pusha T. However, Kendrick later clarified it as "pushing the genre forward" and "friendly competition."</li>
                <li>**Debate erupts online.** Fans and critics dissect the lyrics, sparking discussions about competition and lyricism in hip-hop.</li>

        <h2>March 2024: The Feud Ignites</h2>
        <p>Fast forward to March 2024, and things get heated:
            <ul>
                <li>**Future, Metro Boomin, and Kendrick Lamar release "Like That."**  Many believe Lamar's verse includes subtle digs aimed at Drake, referencing his ghostwriting rumors and his "sensitive" persona.</li>
                <li>**Drake responds swiftly with "Family Matters."**  The gloves come off as Drake accuses Lamar of hypocrisy regarding his social commentary and even throws in personal attacks.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

    <section class="diss-tracks">
        <h2>Diss Track Frenzy (March-May 2024): It Gets Personal</h2>
        <p>The rappers trade barbs with increasing intensity:
            <ul>
                <li>**Kendrick drops "Meet the Grahams,"** escalating the feud to new heights. He levies serious accusations against Drake, including sex trafficking and fathering a secret child.</li>
                <li>**Not done yet, Lamar releases "Not Like Us,"** taking things a step further with disturbing allegations of pedophilia.</li>
                <li>**On May 5th, Drake attempts to defend himself with "The Heart Part 6"**  He denies all accusations and claims Lamar was misled about the secret child.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Aftermath: Where Do We Stand?</h2>
        <p>As of today, there haven't been any further releases from either artist. Here's a look at the current situation:
            <ul>
                <li>**The internet is buzzing.** Fans are divided, with many dissecting every lyric for clues and taking sides.</li>
                <li>**The seriousness of the accusations**  cannot be ignored.  While these are lyrics in a rap battle, they carry weight, and their truthfulness remains unconfirmed.</li>
                <li>**Possible outside influence?**  Speculation exists that Drake's team might have fed Lamar false information regarding the secret child, further fueling the fire.</li>
